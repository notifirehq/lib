# Devtool

`devtool.ts`, `schema.json` and `input.json` is meant to be used to extract json schema object from openapi json.
Put you openapi json in `input.json` and change line 9 in `devtool.ts` to the path where the schema object you need are located. run `npm run devtool` and open `schema.json` and copy the result from there.
