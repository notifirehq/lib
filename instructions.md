The task is to migrate the Integrations page from the old @novu/web package to the new @novu/dashboard UI.

- First start to understand what are the relevant components and pages that we need to migrate.
- Then, create the new pages in the @novu/dashboard package.
- Then, migrate the data and logic from the old package to the new one.
- Make sure to use the new components and theming from the new UI.
- We cannot import anything from the old @novu/web package and need to reimplement the required components.
- Create needed react router routes and update side bar
